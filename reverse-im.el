;;; Commentary:
;; Overrides `function-key-map' parent for preferred input-method
;; to translate input sequences the default system layout (english)
;; so we can use Emacs bindings while non-default system layout is active.

;; Usage example:
;; (use-package reverse-im
;;   :ensure t
;;   :custom
;;   (reverse-im-input-methods '("ukrainian-computer")) ; put your input-method(s) here
;;   :config
;;   (reverse-im-mode t))

;; or, alternatively, add the library to your load-path and
;; (reverse-im-activate "ukrainian-computer") manually
